# SCPSL-SCPAnnouncer

A very simple plugin that uses cassie to anounce the zone(s) scp(s) are located in.
Use console variable scp_announce_time to set the timeout in seconds.

Shoutout to @Arith#7544 for supplying me with code to get the zone a player is cureently in.

For your own safety, don't look into the code. You've been warned. It's nothing pretty or safe.
